Instructions for compiling and using SpECEOSdriver

This EOSdriver is an edited version of Evan O'Connor and Christian
    Ott's EOSdriver from stellarcollapse.org. Changes have been
    made to construct tables for SpEC Hydro evolutions. Instructions
    below for compiling and using the driver, and for git version
    control.

***** Compiling *****
System requirements are a Fortran90 compiler and the HDF5 libraries
with Fortran90 module files and bindings. The latter can be gotten on
    a Mac OS with 'brew install hdf5 --enable-fortran'. (Note: you
    cannot compile hdf5 with fortran bindings AND make the hdf5
    libraries threadsafe with --enable-threadsafe simultaneously.)
Make symbolic links to the appropriate Makefile and make.inc in
    MakefileRules/. e.g.:
$ cd SpECEOSdriver
$ ln -s MakefileRules/Makefile-generic Makefile
$ ln -s MakefileRules/make.inc-MacOS_10_8 make.inc

Download the appropriate h5 table from stellarcollapse.org.

Edit driver.F90 in the "User-Chosen Parameters" section. At a
    minimum choose an eostype, eos, and output resolution.

Compile the driver:
$ make -s driver

***** Running *****
Make the table:
$ driver > mytable.dat

Scan the table for nans, and perform other sanity checks, e.g.
    plot the various columns:
p './GShenFSU21_Tabulated.dat' u 0:1 ev ::11::259 w p
Run the table through some sanity checks with EOSManipAndVis
    executables in SpEC code branch usr/deaton/EOSManipAndVis
